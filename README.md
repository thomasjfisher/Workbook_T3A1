### Q1 |Provide an overview and description of a standard source control process for a large project.



Large projects with many authors contributing need a good Version Control System in order to track changes and avoid mishaps.

### Q2 |What are the most important aspects of quality software?

In order to ensure that the quality of software programs do not suffer, there are many important factors that contribute to the structure and maintenance of quality software. Software quality measure whether software satisfies its requirements. The most prominent aspects found pertained to *reliability, understandability, modifiability, usability, testability, portability, efficiency and integrity / security.*

#### Reliability

Making sure that software behaves correctly and consistently, is the main aspect of reliability. Ensuring that the functionality of the programs is accurate and also repeatable. If the occurrence of an error were to appear, then the way it is to be handled should be quick, efficient and dealt with proactively. Making sure the user is never left wondering if the product will work correctly.

#### Understandability 

A product that has good structure, clear components and a well maintained source code that is able to be understood by anyone using and or reviewing it, are some of the most important things when it comes to the understandability of software products. Also making sure that the product is functioning as intended and the continual support of the source code are what lead to the best understandability of software products.

#### Modifiability 

Ensuring that the modifiability of software is simple to add, delete or change. Some systems require changing very few lines of code in order to change the behaviour of the program. Quality code is that which follows coding conventions, is well documented and readable. Maintaining this will ensure that the modifiability of the software remains simple and that no matter who does make alterations to the code, is it well structured and clear how and where to do so.

#### Usability

The usability of software products must be user friendly. Simple, easy to use and well structured software products are one of the most important aspects when looking at quality aspects. It should be clearly presented and obvious at how the users can and will interact with the software. Users should feel comfortable using the product, be able to know and see clearly how the site layout is and how they can best use the software. Users should have no need to get external help for the software product, it should be clear and concise. 

#### Testability

Being able to verify the functionality of the software is also another very important aspect when it comes to quality software. The testing process must be simple and easily done. If an issue does arise, then it is also important that there is a swift way of dealing with the errors which is the main reason behind testing, and making sure that the software has rigorous testing done to ensure the working product. 

#### Portability 

Portability is by far one of the most important things required when it comes to quality software. With so much choice of hardware and competition of the market when it comes to software and software programs, ensuring that portability is simple and viable are so important. Portable software is usable across all projects, hardware and domains and can easily be recompiled for a different platform.

#### Efficiency 

Efficient software is fast, memory efficient and uses as few resources as possible. Requiring less CPU usage allows for the user to be able to run their software much more efficiently. That may mean something as simple as leaving the user with more battery power, freeing up CPU so that other applications may still run efficiently in the background , etc. When it comes to efficient software programs, they require minimal resources whilst still accomplishing what is required. 

#### Integrity / Security

Another integral part of a software program is the integrity and security. Integrity comes with security, so maintaining and providing proficient support to prevent unauthorised access, prevention of information leaks and losses, ensuring that the software program is free and protected from viruses, and protecting the privacy of data entered. This ensures that users will be able to trust and feel comfortable when using the software program.

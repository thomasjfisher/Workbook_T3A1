### Q1. Provide an overview and description of a standard source control process for a large project.

Amazon Web Services defines source control as: "Source control (or version control) is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code. Source control management (SCM) systems provide a running history of code development and help to resolve conflicts when merging contributions from multiple sources." 

When it comes to large projects, more often than not, there are many contributors to the code. It is due to this, that the process and source control is well handled, and well maintained. A large project must utilise a good source control to keep control of all contributions and changes made. Source control keeps track of all modifications made to the code, and if there is ever a case where a mistake is made, or an error occurs, then there is access to earlier versions of the code which is easily accessible with good source control. 

Multiple software developers working on one project, mainly in teams, are constantly writing new code and updating code. It is for this reason, that the most efficient way for a large team to handle a large project is by organising each team to have and work from a specific fold and or file tree (branch). By doing this, it allows each team to continue to work on their given outcomes without disrupting other teams. 

With each team working on a brach from the master branch, it allows for uninterrupted work flow, which when it comes to a large project, is incredibly important. As show in the image below, you can see that from the master branch, there are multiple branches, each with their very own unique goal and outcome. These are the outcomes that the teams will be given to work on, and is why it is so important to have good source control when working in large groups, on large projects.

### Q2. What are the most important aspects of quality software?

In order to ensure that the quality of software programs do not suffer, there are many important factors that contribute to the structure and maintenance of quality software. Software quality measure whether software satisfies its requirements. The most prominent aspects found pertained to *reliability, understandability, modifiability, usability, testability, portability, efficiency and integrity / security.*

#### Reliability

Making sure that software behaves correctly and consistently, is the main aspect of reliability. Ensuring that the functionality of the programs is accurate and also repeatable. If the occurrence of an error were to appear, then the way it is to be handled should be quick, efficient and dealt with proactively. Making sure the user is never left wondering if the product will work correctly.

#### Understandability 

A product that has good structure, clear components and a well maintained source code that is able to be understood by anyone using and or reviewing it, are some of the most important things when it comes to the understandability of software products. Also making sure that the product is functioning as intended and the continual support of the source code are what lead to the best understandability of software products.

#### Modifiability 

Ensuring that the modifiability of software is simple to add, delete or change. Some systems require changing very few lines of code in order to change the behaviour of the program. Quality code is that which follows coding conventions, is well documented and readable. Maintaining this will ensure that the modifiability of the software remains simple and that no matter who does make alterations to the code, is it well structured and clear how and where to do so.

#### Usability

The usability of software products must be user friendly. Simple, easy to use and well structured software products are one of the most important aspects when looking at quality aspects. It should be clearly presented and obvious at how the users can and will interact with the software. Users should feel comfortable using the product, be able to know and see clearly how the site layout is and how they can best use the software. Users should have no need to get external help for the software product, it should be clear and concise. 

#### Testability

Being able to verify the functionality of the software is also another very important aspect when it comes to quality software. The testing process must be simple and easily done. If an issue does arise, then it is also important that there is a swift way of dealing with the errors which is the main reason behind testing, and making sure that the software has rigorous testing done to ensure the working product. 

#### Portability 

Portability is by far one of the most important things required when it comes to quality software. With so much choice of hardware and competition of the market when it comes to software and software programs, ensuring that portability is simple and viable are so important. Portable software is usable across all projects, hardware and domains and can easily be recompiled for a different platform.

#### Efficiency 

Efficient software is fast, memory efficient and uses as few resources as possible. Requiring less CPU usage allows for the user to be able to run their software much more efficiently. That may mean something as simple as leaving the user with more battery power, freeing up CPU so that other applications may still run efficiently in the background , etc. When it comes to efficient software programs, they require minimal resources whilst still accomplishing what is required. 

#### Integrity / Security

Another integral part of a software program is the integrity and security. Integrity comes with security, so maintaining and providing proficient support to prevent unauthorised access, prevention of information leaks and losses, ensuring that the software program is free and protected from viruses, and protecting the privacy of data entered. This ensures that users will be able to trust and feel comfortable when using the software program.

### Q3. Outline a standard high level structure for a MERN stack application and explain the components.

MERN tack is a combination of 4 technologies used to create a web application. The MERN stack is a Javascript stack that consists of MongDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js. *MongoDB* is a NoSQL document oriented database. MongoDB is schema-less. Data is stored in flexible documents, and access with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) - based query language. *Express* is a framework for Node.js. It is designed for building web applications and web APIs. Is is incredibly fast and has a minimalist structure with many plugin features available for the popular framework. *React.js* Originally developed by software engineers at Facebook, React.js is use to render views in HTML. React uses JavaScript to compile repetitive and conditional DOM elements. React.js is a wonderfully sleek way to create a great user experience. *Node.js* is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, which was designed to build scalable network applications. Each of these powerful technologies makes the MERN stack a very reliable and significant technology for developers.

### Q4. A team is about to engage in a project, developing a website for a small business. What knowledge and skills would they need in order to develop the project?

When it comes to working on a project in teams, it is incredibly important that each developer has a certain level of skill and knowledge required in order to successfully complete the project. Whilst there are some times that developers may excel in a niche technology, it is also important to make sure that the right people with the right knowledge are working on the appropriate task. Depending on which framework is used, the developers will need to have knowledge of that in order to create and finish the project. Having familiarity with the langue and frameworks used is also very important for the projects success. Ensuring that the correct git control practice is also used in order maintain and keep a clear and precise source code. The developers would need knowledge to deploy the project in order to make it accessible to users. The most important skill however, is communication. A project will get absolutely no where if there is lack of communication or poor communication.



### Q5. With reference to one of your own projects, discuss what knowledge or skills were required to complete your project, and to overcome challenges

During the term, we participated in a Hackathon. During this time, my partner Rachel and I created a ToDo app using express. This project required us to have knowledge and skills of node.js, express.js, html, css, understanding routes, MVC (Model View Controller). It also required us to have good comunticaion throughout and an understanding of each other, our work flow and our work load. We created a Trello board in order to visualise what needed to be done in order to create our app. We set out our MVP (Most Viable Product) and then added in features we wanted. By setting aside time to the planning of our app, it allowed for us to see what skills and knowledge we needed in order to create each element of our app. By doing so, we could also play to our strengths. As one developer was more confident on the back end and the other on front end, we then made columns to divide up what tasks needed to be done for each part of the app. Working to our strengths helped in the creation process, and also allowed for us to share our knowledge and experience of the front / back end. 

### Q6. With reference to one of your own projects, evaluate how effective your knowledge and skills were for this project, and suggest changes or improvements for future projects of a similar nature

When I developed my rails application, it required me to be able to think for myself, research hard and accurately and also to be more specific when googling an issue. As it was my first time using Rails, I spent much time reading documentation and playing around with many different aspects. When it came to the implementation of deploying to Heroku, it required set up and time invested into reading the documentation in order to grasp the concept and idea. I had intended to implement a payment system using Stripe, however as I ran out of time I did not get to. However, I did spend time trying to implement that and reading the documentation. 
Going forward into other projects, looking back, it is clear that reading the documentation and getting an understanding of what I am doing for the project and why I am doing is crucial in order to create a great functioning app. Allowing enough time and practice in order to gain the required knowledge too is crucial. 

### Q7. Explain control flow, using an example from the JavaScript programming language

Control flow is the order in which function calls, instructions and statements are executed by a program when it is run. 

```
var age = 21;
if (age >= 18) {
console.log("Can drink responsibly")
}else {
console.log("You have to wait until you're 18!")
}
```

In the code snippet above, the way each line is executed show that the variable age is defined first. The second line is then checking that if age is greater or equal to 18, then print to the console, "Can drink responsibly". If age is not greater or equal to 18 then "You have to wait until you're 18!" will print to the console. The control flow here is checking the age, it is then check if it is greater or equal to, if yes, do option 1, if no, it proceeds to the next line of code and then if that matches, it executes that code.

### Q8. Explain type coercion, using examples from the JavaScript programming language

Type coercion is the process of converting a value from one type to another.

```javascript
// converting a number to a string
var num1 = '5'
var num2 = 5
sum = (num1 + num2)
console.log(sum)
// This will return '55'
```

With the above code, most would expect the outcome to be `10`! However, javascript  coerced `num2` to a string and then concatenated the values together, which returns a string of `55`. However, if we wanted the sum to equal `10`, then the best way to do that would be as follows:

```javascript
// converting a string to a number
var num1 = '5'
var num2 = 5
var sum = Number(num1) + num2
console.log(sum)
// This will return 10
```

Another whacky way that coercion takes place, is on booleans! Booleans 'true' has a value of `1` as it is a truthy value, whilst 'false' has a value of `0` as it is falsy. 

```javascript
// converting the boolean to a number
var x = true + 2
console.log(x)
// This will return 3

var y = false + 2
conole.log(y)
// this will return 2
```

Another way coercion takes place is with the Equality Operator. This is where the equality operator (==) is used to compare values, regardless of their type. It is done by coercing a non number data type into a number.

```javascript
var x = (10 == '10')
var y = (true == 1)
// these will all return `true`
```

### Q13. For the code snippet provided below, write comments for each line of code to explain its functionality. In your comments you must demonstrate your ability to recognise and identify functions, ranges and classes

```javascript
// declaring the class Car
class Car {

// defining the attribute of the class Car
  constructor(brand) {
    this.carname = brand;
  }
  
// defining a function that all class of "Car" has
  present() {
  
// car.present() will return the cars brand 
    return 'I have a ' + this.carname;
  }
}

// declares that the class Model extends from Car, therefore inheriting all the attributes of // the class Car
class Model extends Car {

// Model is inheriting brand from Car via the use of super
  constructor(brand, mod) {
    super(brand);
    this.model = mod;
  }
  
 // a new class function show is defined which is adding model information when returned
  show() {
    return this.present() + ', it was made in ' + this.model;
  }
}

// declares an array named 'makes' with three strings inside.
let makes = ["Ford", "Holden", "Toyota"]

// array.from is creating a shallow-copied array 40 times
// (x,i) => i + 1980 is a map funciton, which returns the value of each index of an array and adds 1980 to it.
let models = Array.from(new Array(40), (x,i) => i + 1980)

// function returns a min and max value using Math.floor to round the nuber down to a whole 
// number
function randomIntFromInterval(min,max) { // min and max included
    return Math.floor(Math.random()*(max-min+1)+min);
}

// for loop declared of model of models
for (model of models) {

//randomly selects from the array make
  make = makes[randomIntFromInterval(0,makes.length-1)]
  
// when run in my terminal, this returns the make of the car from either 1980, 1981 or 1982, as 
// the array that contains makes has only 3 values 
  model = models[randomIntFromInterval(0,makes.length-1)]
  
// a new model class is made with the attributes generated randomly 
  mycar = new Model(make, model);
  
// logs to the console 40 times, with the newly generated strings as defined previously in make
// and model classes
  console.log(mycar.show())
}
```
